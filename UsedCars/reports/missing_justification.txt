Missing-value handling used:
- If a column had >40% missing values we dropped it (it likely lacks sufficient data).
- For numeric columns with <=40% missing: impute median (robust to outliers).
- For categorical columns with <=40% missing: impute mode (most common category).
These choices balance retaining useful features vs avoiding excessive imputation bias.
