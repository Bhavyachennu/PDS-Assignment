Assignment 1 — Data Analysis & Visualization
This repo has my work for Assignment 1, split into two parts:
Frailty Analysis – checking hand grip strength and frailty in females.
Student Performance – exploring and visualizing student scores.
Q1 — Frailty Analysis
Goal: See how hand grip strength relates to frailty for 10 female participants.
What I did:
Made a CSV with the raw data.
Converted height to meters and weight to kilograms.
Calculated BMI and grouped ages into categories.
Encoded frailty as 0/1 and one-hot encoded the age groups.
Checked basic stats (mean, median, std) for the numeric columns.
Looked at how grip strength and frailty relate using correlation.
Saved the results:
Processed data CSV
Findings in a markdown file
A text file explaining step-by-step what I did
Q2 — Student Performance Visualization
Goal: Explore student scores and see patterns based on gender, test prep, lunch type, etc.
What I did:
Loaded the CSV and cleaned data / handled missing values.
Calculated overall average scores.
Made 5 visualizations (saved as PNGs):
Gender boxplots for math vs reading
Math scores by test prep
Average performance by lunch type
Correlation heatmap for all subjects
Math vs reading scatter plot with trend lines by test prep
Saved reports:
Analysis explanations in markdown
A text file with step-by-step notes
